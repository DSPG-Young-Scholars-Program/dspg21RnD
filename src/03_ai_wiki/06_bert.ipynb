       "'Project SummaryGeneration of the eye, more so than many organs, requires precise control of its shape for optimal function.Obtaining knowledge of how the eye and lens is constructed during embryonic development is thereforeimportant to help describe the nature of ocular abnormalities that lead to major structural defects or moresubtle changes that alter vision. An example of a morphogenetic event required for the generation of organs isepithelial invagination. This process drives the inward bending of epithelia of several early organ systemsincluding that of the lens placode during early ocular development. Although several mechanisms have beenproposed to drive this process, such as apical constriction or local placodal growth, none have been foundsufficient to account for epithelial bending. We have recently observed that placodal cells change shape,move, and generate cytoskeletal structures in a planar polarized manner that produces a net flow of cellstoward the central placode. One of the hallmarks of planar-polarized cell movements such as these is theformation and resolution of cellular rosettes, an organized process of cell rearrangement that requires spatialrestriction of junctional proteins that contract and shorten junctions and proteins that lengthen and stabilizecellular junctions. We have identified planar-polarized localization of proteins responsible for junctionalcontraction (Shroom3 and p120-catenin) and stabilization (Par3 and cdc42). These results led us to ourcentral hypothesis that invagination is driven by a combination of epithelial cell movements and anisotropic cellshape changes organized by radial planar polarized protein localization, junction contraction, and junctionelongation. We will test this central hypothesis with three aims utilizing live-fluorescent microscopy ofgenetically altered mouse embryos. In aim 1 we will characterize the role of anisotropic junctional contractionand analyze the consequences of combined deficiency of Shroom3 and p120 catenin. The goal of aim 2 is tocharacterize the role of Par3 in junction elongation during rosette resolution and invagination. Aim 3 willinvestigate whether anisotropic cell geometry and movement results from the mutual antagonism betweenproteins that induce junctional contraction and junctional elongation. Once completed, the experiments in thisproposal will define the cell behaviors that drive the mechanisms of lens placode invagination.'"
