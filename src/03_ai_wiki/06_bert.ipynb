       "\"The multiprotein complex y-secretase proteolytically cleaves the intramembrane region of amyloid precursorprotein (APP), which in turn forms the plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The catalyticcomponent of Y-secretase is the intramembrane aspartyl protease (IAP) called presenilin. Mutations inpresenilin are directly linked to familial early-onset AD. Another known member of the IAP family is signalpeptide peptidase (SPP), which functions to further proteolyze remnant signal peptides after they have beencleaved by signal peptidase. Knowledge of the biochemistry and function of individual SPPs are onlybeginning to be elucidated, and homologues are found in all kingdoms of life. Presenilin and SPP exhibitsignificant sequence similarity, strongly suggesting they share structural and catalytic features. Thus, amolecular understanding of the more tractable SPP will likely impact drug design for presenilin and y-secretase. The goal of this proposal is to express, characterize, and solve the crystal structure of anextremophilic bacterial SPP ortholog by itself, with a transition-state analog inhibitor and with a substratemimic. In addition, drug candidates will be screened in silico. This first structure of an intramembraneprotease will provide critical insight into the biochemistry of intramembrane proteolysis and enable structure-based AD drug development and screening.\""
