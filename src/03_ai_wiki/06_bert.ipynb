An example of a morphogenetic event required for the generation of organs isepithelial invagination. This process drives the inward bending of epithelia of several early organ systemsincluding that of the lens placode during early ocular development. Although several mechanisms have beenproposed to drive this process, such as apical constriction or local placodal growth, none have been foundsufficient to account for epithelial bending. We have recently observed that placodal cells change shape,move, and generate cytoskeletal structures in a planar polarized manner that produces a net flow of cellstoward the central placode. One of the hallmarks of planar-polarized cell movements such as these is theformation and resolution of cellular rosettes, an organized process of cell rearrangement that requires spatialrestriction of junctional proteins that contract and shorten junctions and proteins that lengthen and stabilizecellular junctions. We have identified planar-polarized localization of proteins responsible for junctionalcontraction (Shroom3 and p120-catenin) and stabilization (Par3 and cdc42). These results led us to ourcentral hypothesis that invagination is driven by a combination of epithelial cell movements and anisotropic cellshape changes organized by radial planar polarized protein localization, junction contraction, and junctionelongation. We will test this central hypothesis with three aims utilizing live-fluorescent microscopy ofgenetically altered mouse embryos. In aim 1 we will characterize the role of anisotropic junctional contractionand analyze the consequences of combined deficiency of Shroom3 and p120 catenin. The goal of aim 2 is tocharacterize the role of Par3 in junction elongation during rosette resolution and invagination. Aim 3 willinvestigate whether anisotropic cell geometry and movement results from the mutual antagonism betweenproteins that induce junctional contraction and junctional elongation. Once completed, the experiments in thisproposal will define the cell behaviors that drive the mechanisms of lens placode invagination.'"

It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon.[7] The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi's dome by Michelozzo. Bramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.\""
